      <description>The <b>Keystore</b> view stores all JCrypTool cryptographic keys in a single place. This includes public and private key pairs (asymmetric), secret keys (symmetric) as well as certificates. These keys are available for use by any part of JCrypTool. 

For convenience, JCrypTool is shipped with some default keys. The default password for these keys is <b>1234</b>.

JCrypTool internal keys normally begin with <b>JCT</b>. These keys are automatically generated by a crypto plug-in and should be deleted only if there is a need for it. Some plug-ins will automatically regenerate keys the next time they are used.

Use the toolbar to create new keys, delete existing or to im- and export keys.
