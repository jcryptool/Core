    <h1>Crypto Provider</h1>

    <p>The preferences dialog contains an overview about all in JCrypTool available crypto providers and their versions. With the <strong>Up</strong> and <strong>Down</strong> buttons (on the right side) it is possible to select their order. The first crypto provider automatically becomes the default crypto provider.</p>

    <p>When selecting a certain algorithm in one of the crypto plug-ins, JCrypTool tries to find an implementation for it. The installed crypto providers are searched through whether they provide this algorithm. The provider found first is used. In case none of the installed providers offers support for an algorithm an error is shown.</p>

    <p>Currently the default crypto provider in JCrypTool is <strong>FlexiProvider</strong>. Additionally <strong>BouncyCastle</strong> is included in every installation. BouncyCastle will become the default crypto provider in one of the next versions of JCT.</p>
