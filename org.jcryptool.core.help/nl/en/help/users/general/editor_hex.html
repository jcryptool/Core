	<h1>Hexeditor</h1>

	<p>The <strong>Hexeditor</strong> can be used to view and edit all types of files.</p>

	<p>The view-/editarea adapts automatically to the window size and has a text preview area on the right side. Changes can be made directly
	to these areas and can be undone.</p>

	<p>Use the menu <strong>Edit -> Open with -> Texteditor</strong> to open the currently opened file in the <a href="editor_text.html">Texteditor</a>.
	The Hexeditor will be closed automatically.</p>
	<p>Here can find a manual for the hexeditor: <a href="editor_hex_manual.html">Hexeditor manual</a>
	
	<p>The hex editor has a status bar at the bottom of the JCrypTool. It is divided into three areas. The left area shows whether characters entered are inserted or existing characters are overwritten. The middle area shows the value of the current byte in hexadecimal, decimal and binary form. The right area shows the number of the current byte and the total number of bytes in the document. If multiple bytes are selected, the number of the first and last byte of the selection is shown. Both numbers are in decimal and hexadecimal form.</p>
