	<h1>Crypto Explorer</h1>

	<p>The <strong>Crypto Explorer</strong> view displays all crypto operations  available (installed) in the  <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.jcryptool.core.help/$nl$/help/users/general/perspective_default.html">Default Perspective</a> of JCrypTool. All possible operations are listed on the four tabs <strong>Algorithms</strong>, <strong>Analysis</strong>, <strong>Games</strong>, and <strong>Visualizations</strong>. You can double click an algorithm in the <strong>Algorithms</strong> tab to apply it to the data of the current  editor. It is also possible to drag&drop the algorithm directly on the editor to utilize it. Entries on the other three tabs <strong>Analysis</strong>, <strong>Games</strong>, and <strong>Visualizations</strong> do not require an opened editor normally. Instead they open a view for further operations. The launched action after a double click depends on the implementation of the crypto plug-in.</p>

    <h2>Inactive menu entries</h2>

    <p>All algorithms, in the Crypto Explorer view as well as in the menu, do require an open file in one of the JCrypTool <a href="editors.html">editors</a>.
    Launching an algorithm wizard via the Crypto Explorer view will result into an error message without an opened file. The entries in the Algorithm menu are inactive without an opened file. This constraint only affects <strong>Algorithms</strong>, the other three categories <strong>Analysis</strong>, <strong>Games</strong> and <strong>Visualizations</strong> normally do not require an open file in one of the editors.</p>

	<h2>Menu and view</h2>

	<p>Generally the Crypto Explorer view lists all available (installed) crypto plug-ins, sorted by type and category. All those entries can be found in the menu bar too. With the views menu (the drop down arrow) it is possible to switch between the tree and the palette layout (default). Both, the menu and the view, always contain the same data, no matter whether the view is shown as palette or as tree.</p>
