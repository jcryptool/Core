	<h2 id="opennew">Quick way to open a new editor</h2>

	<p>To open a new editor (text or hex, empty or filled with a default file) just click on the leftmost icon in the <strong>main toolbar</strong> or the drop-down arrow next to the right. See the screenshots with important icons in the help file <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.jcryptool.core.help/$nl$/help/users/general/toc.html">General Information</a>.</p>





<p> </br> </p>
	<h2 id="max">Maximizing the window of a plugin</h2>

	<p>You might have opened the default view with editors, the context help, and some visualizations. If you then want one of them to be maximized just <strong>double-click</strong> on the tab (e.g. on the "Frequency Analysis" tab within the visualizations).</p>

	<h2 id="fastinfo">How to quickly find information in JCT</h2>

	<p>First of all, you can click the magnifying glass icon in the <strong>main toolbar</strong> in order to get help about a particular topic. Then the <b>Quick Access search field</b> opens: Preferably, you can look for name of plug-ins or of a method.</p>

	<p>Screenshots with important icons in the help file <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.jcryptool.core.help/$nl$/help/users/general/toc.html">General Information</a>.</p>

	<p>Alternatively, you can open the exhaustive online help in a browser: To do so, click in JCT on the question-mark icon within the <strong>main toolbar</strong>. Within the online help then click on the left on the entry <b><img src="./../images/plus.svg" /><img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.jcryptool.core.help/$nl$/help/users/images/toc_open.svg" />User Guide</b>. Now you can see the different categories, used to structure the help in JCT. To open a category, please click on the small plus icon in front of the particular category. So you can navigate to the according help page and get a good overview. Alternatively, you can use the search field (at the top below the browser toolbar) in the online help.</p>

	<h2 id="languageswitch">Changing the language in JCrypTool</h2>
	
	<p>In the general preferences of JCrypTool you can change the language. After a change JCT asks you to automatically restart with the new selected language. Further details about this can be found in <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.jcryptool.core.help/$nl$/help/users/general/language.html">Changing the Language</a>.</p>

	<h2 id="updating">Updating JCrypTool</h2>
	
	<p>JCrypTool contains an integrated update mechanism. Details about this and hints for problem solving can be found in <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.jcryptool.core.help/$nl$/help/users/general/updates.html">Updates</a>.</p>
	
	<!--- Just as info: this was it before using PLUGINS_ROOT

	<h2 id="usb">Using JCrypTool in a network environment or on a USB stick</h2>

	<p>In principle it is possible to use JCrypTool in a network environment or on an external storage medium like a USB stick or a USB hard disk. To enable this you have to do a minor change in one of the configuration files: It is necessary to change the path to the default workspace folder. This folder is used by all plug-ins to store your specific preferences.</p>

	<p><strong>Windows/ Linux:</strong></p>
	<p>Open the file <strong>JCrypTool.ini</strong> in your installation folder and search for the line
	<strong>-data @user.home/documents/.jcryptool</strong>. Replace <strong>@user.home/documents/.jcryptool</strong> with the absolute path to a folder available in your environment.</p>

	<p><strong>macOS:</strong></p>
	<p>The required changes are identical with the ones described above for Windows/Linux. However, the file
	<strong>JCrypTool.ini</strong> is located at <strong>JCrypTool.app\Contents\MacOS</strong> in your installation folder.</p>
