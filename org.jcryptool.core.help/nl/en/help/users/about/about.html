	<h1>About JCrypTool</h1>

	<p>JCrypTool (JCT) is an extendable e-learning platform presenting cryptography, cryptanalysis, and IT Security in a modern and easy-to-use fashion.</p>
	
    <p>JCrypTool is built as platform-independent open-source software and is part of the open-source project <a href="http://www.cryptool.org/" target="_blank">CrypTool</a>.</p>
	
    <p>A tabular overview about all functions in all CrypTool programs including JCT can be found at the CrypTool website in the <a href="https://www.cryptool.org/en/documentation/functionvolume" target="_blank">function overview</a>.</p>

	<p>An exhaustive overview what you can do with JCT can be found in the <a href="https://www.cryptool.org/en/jct/documentation/user-presentation" target="_blank">User presentation of the JCrypTool project</a>.</p>
	
	<p>JCT is developed since 2009. More than 200 people contributed. After many weekly builds, beta versions and 9 milestone versions, the release 1.0 was published in November 2020. JCT contains about 250 cryptologic functions, many of them as visualizations. We learned a lot about remote and agile programming, and about the hurdles of the Java infrastructure, and had exciting contacts to people from many contributing universities. Most important, we hope the users will have fun learning and experiencing cryptography and cryptanalysis with JCrypTool.</p>
