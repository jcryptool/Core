<h1>Keystore</h1>

	<p>The JCrypTool keystore contains all predefined and self-generated keys for cryptographic operations. It contains among others keys for RSA, ElGamal, AES and ECDH. For the user "Alice" there are predefined keys for all algorithms: They allow a quick start in JCrypTool and all have the same <b>password 1234</b>.

	<p>The keystore is required in both perspectives, the Default Perspective and the Algorithm Perspective. It provides keys for certain cryptographic operations.</p>

	<p>In the Default Perspective the keystore can be opened via the menu <b>Algorithms -> Keystore</b>. In the Algorithm Perspective, the keystore is open by default. If it is not open, it can be opened via the menu <b>Window -> Show View -> Keystore</b>.</p>

	<p>The key store allows you to create, view, delete, import and export keys. Many of these actions are available with a right click on a key.</p>
