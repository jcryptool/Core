<h1>Time Table / time travel through cryptography and cryptanalysis</h1>

<P>This <B>overview</B> of the various <B>cryptographic algorithms</B> is a chronological history of cryptology, whose origins date back to the days of antiquity and which over time has undergone steady refinement of its methods. Please note that this table is by no means complete.</P>

<P>The first human writing dates back more than 6000 years. Encryption has been in existence for around 3000 years.</P>

<td>The "dark age of cryptography" began in Europe: During this period cryptography was considered as black magic art and a lot of knowledge was lost. By contrast cryptography flourished in the Persian world.</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>855 AD</td>
<td>In the Arabic world the first book on cryptology appeared. Among other things, Abu 'Abd al-Raham al-Khahil ibn Ahmad ibn'Amr ibn Tammam al Farahidi al-Zadi al Yahamadi (Abu-Yusuf Ya&#8217;qub ibn Ishaq al-Kindi, called <strong>Al-Kindi</strong>) proudly described in his book the successful decryption of a Greek ciphertext that was intended for the Byzantine Emperor. His solution was based on frequency analysis and on known (correctly guessed) plaintext at the message start &ndash; a standard cryptanalytic method, used even in WW-II against Enigma messages.</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>1379</td>
<td>When the pontifex Clement VII escaped to Avignion, he made his secretary Gabrieli di Lavinde (Parma) to develop a new code, which became the <strong>nomenclature code</strong>, a combination of substituting single letters of the alphabet and code words: He built a list of the most common words together with 2-letter substitutes. The words, that weren't on the list were encrypted with monoalphabetic substitution.<br /> Due to its simplicity this nomenclature code was used over the next 450 years especially in diplomatic circles.</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>1412</td>
<td>A 14-volume Arabic encyclopaedia also described cryptographic methods. Here, in addition to <strong>substitution</strong> and <strong>transposition</strong>, the method of <strong>repeated substitution</strong> applied to a plaintext character was mentioned the first time.</td>

<tr valign="top">

<tr valign="top">
<td>1585</td>
<td>The 600-page book "Tracti&#233; de Chiffre" by the French diplomat, Blaise de Vigen&#232;re, appeared. He discovered the first working polyalphabetic system with autokey, called "Le chiffre ind&#233;chiffrable". Later the weaker <strong>Vigen&#232;re code</strong> was named after him. This code is the most well-known of all the poly-alphabetic algorithms.<br /> The autokey idea survived today e.g. in the DES CBC and CFB modes.</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>1586</td>
<td>The <strong>Babington plot</strong> tried to kill the Queen Elisabeth I. of England and to replace her on the throne by <strong>Mary Stuart</strong>, Queen of Scotland. <br /> Successful cryptanalysis by the "British secret service" enabled to get the six conspirators and to condemn Mary. <br /> Mary communicated via letters with her conspirators. The bearer of the messages was a spy of Elisabeth: He made exact copies of the letters and sent them to Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth's secretary of state. Walsingham engaged Thomas <strong>Phelippes</strong>, a cipher and language expert, to decrypt the messages. Successful decryption revealed the plot against Elisabeth. But Walsingham additionally wanted the identity of the conspirators: He made Phelippes forge a postscript, and Mary added the enciphered names of the conspirators in her answer.</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>17th century</td>
<td>The era of the <strong>black chambers</strong> began. Most governments had their own department with professional code breakers, who systematically broke the used nomenclature codes.</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>1623</td>
<td>Sir Francis <strong>Bacon</strong> described a method of steganography: To encode a message each letter of the plaintext is replaced by a group of five of the letters 'A' or 'B' interspersed into normal text with different typeface. This is a forerunner of what today is called a 5-bit binary encoding.</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">

</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>1854</td>
<td>The English mathematics professor Charles <strong>Babbage</strong> invented a cylindrical cipher device, similar to the "wheel cipher". And he was the first to find a cryptanalytic way to break Vigen&#232;re's autokey cipher (the "unbreakable cipher" of the time) as well as the much weaker cipher that is called Vigen&#232;re cipher today: This did not become public until looking over his remains in the 20th century.</td>

His friend, Lord Lyon Playfair, Baron of St. Andrews, made this public in military and diplomatic circles in Victorian England, and thus it became known as the <strong>Playfair cipher</strong>.</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">

<tr valign="top">
<td>1883</td>
<td>"La Cryptographie militaire" by Auguste <strong>Kerckhoff </strong>von Nieuwendhoff appeared. This constituted a cryptographic milestone in the telegraph era.

</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>1891</td>

</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>1918</td>
<td>The French cryptanalyst, Lieutenant Georges Painvin broke the <strong>ADFGVX</strong> cipher, which was put into service by the Germans near the end of World War I. This was a 2-step cipher which first performed a substitution (each letter was substituted by a bigram through a keyed array), and then the bigrams were fractionated in columns and the columns transpositioned.</td>
