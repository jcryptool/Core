<h1>Cryptographic Mechanisms</h1>

<P>Britannica (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com">http://www.britannica.com</a>) starts its definition with:</P>

<P><B>Cryptology</B> (from the Greek <I>kryptós, </I>"hidden," and <I>lógos, </I>"word") is the science of secure (generally secret) communications. This security obtains from legitimate users, the transmitter and the receiver, being able to transform information into a cipher by virtue of a key &ndash; <I>i.e.,</I> a piece of information known only to them. Although the cipher is inscrutable and often unforgeable to anyone without this secret key, the authorized receiver can either decrypt the cipher to recover the hidden information or verify that it was sent in all likelihood by someone possessing the key.</P>

<P><B>Cryptography </B>(from the Greek <I>kryptós</I> and <I>gráphein,</I> "to write") is the study of the principles and techniques by which information can be concealed in ciphers and later revealed by legitimate users employing the secret key, but in which it is either impossible or computationally infeasible for an unauthorized person to do so.</P>

<P><B>Cryptanalysis</B> (from the Greek <I>kryptós</I> and<I> analýein</I>, "to loosen" or "to untie") is the science (and art) of recovering information from ciphers without knowledge of the key.</P>

<P><B>Cryptography </B>was concerned initially with providing secrecy for written messages. Its principles apply equally well, however, to securing data flow between computers, to digitized speech, and to encrypting facsimile and television signals. Most communications satellites, for example, routinely encrypt the data flow to and from ground stations to provide both privacy and security for their subscribers. Because of this broadened interpretation of cryptography, the field of cryptanalysis has also been enlarged to include the recovery of information from ciphers concealing any form of data.</P>

<P>The easiest way to describe the techniques on which cryptography depends is to first examine some simple cipher systems and abstract from these examples features that apply to more complex systems."</P>

<P>So the modern (mathematical) science of cryptology contains not only mechanisms for encryption but also for integrity, electronic signatures, random numbers, secure key exchange, secure containers, electronic voting and electronic money, and has achieved to render a broad range of applications in modern life.</P>

<P>Most books today do not make a difference any more between the word "cryptography" and "cryptology", because this has only historical reasons.</P>

<p>The relationship of cryptology and IT security and risk management is described <a href="cryptology.html">here.</a>
