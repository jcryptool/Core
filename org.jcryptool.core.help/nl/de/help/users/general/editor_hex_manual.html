				<em>javahexeditor</em>
				User Guide
			</h1>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				<em>javahexeditor</em>
				is a
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_editor" target="_blank">hex
					editor
				</a>
				written in
				<a href="http://java.sun.com" target="_blank">Java</a>
				. It is available as
				<a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="_blank">Eclipse</a>
				plugin and as a stand-alone application for Windows, Linux and MacOS
				X using
				<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/swt" target="_blank">SWT</a>
				widgets. It offers:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Support for very large files</li>
				<li> Hex, ASCII and Unicode find</li>
				<li>Overwrite/insert modes</li>
				<li>Binary and text cut/copy/paste</li>
				<li>Undo/redo</li>
				<li>English and German screen texts</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Usage</h2>
			<h3>Eclipse Editor</h3>
			Any file currently in the workspace (but not part of a jar file) with
			one of the extensions listed below can be opened with
			<em>javahexeditor</em>
			by right clicking on the file name, expanding the "Open With" menu
			item, and selecting
			<em>javahexeditor</em>
			:
			<br />
			<code>a, bin, cab, class, com, dat, data, drv, dll, exe, hex, iso,
				jar, lib, o, out, part, pdf, png, ram, res, rom, sys, txt, zip
			</code>
			.
			<br />
			Other file extensions can be added in the preferences dialog via
			"Window / Preferences... / General / Editors / File Associations".

			<h3>Browsing the File Content</h3>
			<p>You can move around the file as you would in any other text
				editor. To change from hex to text, or vice versa, press the [Tab]
				key, or click the mouse in
				the appropriate area.
			</p>
			<p> To locate a specific position within the file use the Goto
				dialog. The dialog can be opened via the menu item "Edit / Go to
				Location.." (CTRL-L). This
				kind of positioning is especially useful
				when editing very big files and the scroll bar is not accurate
				enough.
			</p>
			<p> To select text move the cursor to the selection start and then
				press the SHIFT key when changing the cursor to the selection end.
			</p>
			<h3>Editing the File Content</h3>
			<p>There are two modify modes: insert and overwrite. You can switch
				between insert/overwrite modes with the INSERT key in your keyboard
				(as in some text
				editors, for instance).
			</p>
			<p>You can insert/delete/trim bytes in insert mode only. In overwrite
				mode the file length never changes and you cannot paste things
				bigger than the space
				left in the file.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can insert other files by copying by copying them to the
				clipboard. This can be achieve for example via "Edit / Copy"
				(CTRL-C) in Windows and and
				pasting it in
				<em>javahexeditor</em>
				via "Edit / Paste" (CTRL-V). Copying to a text editor has a limit of
				4 MB. Binary copying (from
				<em>javahexeditor</em>
				to
				<em>javahexeditor</em>
				) is limited by the free disk space only.
			</p>
			<p> Modified text is displayed in blue, so it is easier to see the
				changes made to the file.
