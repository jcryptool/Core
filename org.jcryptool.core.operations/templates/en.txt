Usage and Overview
==================

Use this sample file for a quick start with JCrypTool, the
platform-independent cryptography e-learning platform.
For instance, 
- encrypt or digitally sign it using the 'Algorithms' menu,
- apply one of the analysis methods in the 'Analysis' menu.

The fast search helps to find 'actions' like particular algorithms,
analyses, visualizations or games). Open it with the magnifying
glass icon in the toolbar, or by pressing "Ctrl+3".

Details
=======
- The 'Crypto Explorer' on the right side lists all the items
  which are also in the menus 'Algorithms', 'Analysis', 'Visuals'
  and 'Games'.
- A double click on an entry in the 'Algorithms' tab launches
  a wizard which guides you step by step through the process.
- Most algorithms in Algorithms and Analysis require a file
  opened in one of the JCrypTool editors.
- Visualizations and Games on the other hand are normally
  independent of any opened file.
- The original file remains untouched all the time.
- More information on learning, using and extending JCrypTool is
  available in the extensive online help, which can be accessed
  via the menu 'Help' --> 'Help Contents'.
